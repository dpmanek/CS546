				<h2>A peek into my life</h2>
				<p>
					Hi! My name is deep manek. I am 24 years old. I love watching Anime.
					It's one of my favorite things to do in my free time. I have other
					interests like working out in the gym, playing guitar, going on treks,
					exploring new places. I have been a full-stack developer for almost
					3-years now. I have worked on various full-stack projects which
					involved integrating chatbots created using NLP tools like Google
					Dialogflow, Microsoft Bot Framework over MERN Stack platforms.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am from India, my nuclear family consists of my parents and a
					younger brother. I am pursuing Masters in Computer Science at Stevens
					so that I can turn my life around and provide my family a life of
					lavishness that I have always envisioned. I really love Professor
					Hill's class. Hopefully, if I perform good enough, I intend to work
					with him on various projects and also request for a TA/RA position if
					available. He says there is too much competition and its gonna be
					tough. But, I anyways believe that good things dont come that easy. So
					I am gonna give it my all.
